This problem consists of one program.

prob3.c: This program creates a fork and then tells you when/if you are
in the child process and/or the parent process. To compile the program, 
use the provided Makefile in the terminal by using the make command. To
run the program, use ./prob3
It should print out both parent and child messages.
